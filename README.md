### Problem Statement
The main problem this project aims to address is the lack of understanding regarding the impact of ChatGPT on Stack Overflow activity. Specifically, we want to investigate how the availability of ChatGPT as a coding assistance tool has influenced user behavior, question quality, and question complexity on Stack Overflow. By conducting a thorough analysis, we can identify any changes and trends that have emerged since the release of ChatGPT.

### Data Understanding
Our data was obtained from <a href='https://data.stackexchange.com/'>Stack Overflow Data Explorer</a> portal. We used a SQL query to obtain the data:

    SELECT Id, CreationDate, Score, ViewCount, AnswerCount
            FROM Posts
            WHERE Tags LIKE '%<python>%','%<R>%'
            AND CreationDate BETWEEN '2022–10–01' AND '2023–04–30'
            AND PostTypeId = 1;

We proceeded to group the data on a weekly basis to minimize interference, resulting in a dataset spanning from Monday, October 2008, to October 1st, 2023. This dataset includes the following features that were collected;

|    Feature          |      Description                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Id**              | Unique identifier for each question or post.               |
| **CreationDate**    | Timestamp of when the question or post was created.       |
| **Score**           | Cumulative upvotes and downvotes, indicating popularity.  |
| **ViewCount**       | Count of times the question or post was viewed.           |
| **AnswerCount**     | Number of answers the question has received.              |
| **Title**           | The headline summarizing the post's topic.               |
| **Tags**            | Keywords or labels categorizing the content.              |
| **CommentCount**    | Count of comments on the post.                            |
| **OwnerDisplayName**| Display name of the post's author.                        |
| **LastEditDate**    | Timestamp of the last edit made to the post.              |
| **LastActivityDate**| Timestamp of the last activity related to the post.       |

The aggregated dataset, spanning from November 2020 to October 2023 with monthly granularity, holds significant value for the project. This data's utility lies in its ability to provide temporal insights and facilitate longitudinal analysis, enabling the assessment of trends, patterns, and changes over time within the Stack Overflow community,thus essential for making future predictions. By reducing daily noise and offering a broader statistical sample, it supports the evaluation of ChatGPT's impact, in the short term influence on user behavior and question quality.

### Data Preparation
- Identifying mising values
- Dropping the missing columns
- Converting CreationDate to datetime format
- Converting the Tags column to string data type

### Hypothesis Testing
#### H1 Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis: ChatGPT does not decrease the number of questions asked on Stack Overflow.
- Alternative Hypothesis: ChatGPT decreases the number of questions asked on Stack Overflow.
- Significance Level = 0.05

#### Result
- We conducted a statistical analysis using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model to estimate the causal effect of the ChatGPT release on Python questions compared to R questions. 
- The results of this analysis revealed that ChatGPT has had a statistically significant effect on the number of questions asked. 
- The model showed that the number of Python questions decreased compared to R questions after the ChatGPT release, supporting the alternative hypothesis.

#### H2 Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis (H0): ChatGPT does not have an effect on the quality of the questions asked.
- Alternative Hypothesis (HA): ChatGPT has an effect on the quality of the questions asked, and it increases the quality.

- To test this hypothesis, we performed the Mann-Whitney U test. The results of the Mann-Whitney U test indicated a statistically significant difference in the distribution of scores, with ChatGPT contributing to an increase in the quality of questions asked. Thus, we rejected the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

- Additionally, we applied a regression analysis to understand the specific effect of ChatGPT on question scores. The regression results showed that ChatGPT had a negative effect on question scores, indicating lower average scores for questions generated with ChatGPT.

### Time Series Models
Three time series models were used: SARIMA, XGBoost, and Prophet.
- SARIMA: A seasonal ARIMA model was fit to the monthly time series data to forecast future trends in question volume and quality. This baseline model accounts for seasonality and autocorrelation.
- XGBoost: An XGBoost regressor was trained on lagged features to capture non-linear patterns and relationships between prior values and future targets. Hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian optimization to maximize forecast accuracy.
- Prophet: Facebook's Prophet model was used to forecast question volumes and quality metrics. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily season.

### Conclusion
The project provides evidence that ChatGPT has influenced both the number and quality of questions asked on Stack Overflow. While the number of questions has decreased, indicating potential automation of certain question types by ChatGPT, the quality of questions has seen an increase, likely due to ChatGPT's assistance in generating more coherent and well-structured questions. However, the actual effects and their magnitude should be interpreted in the context of the specific analysis and limitations of the data and models used. The combination of statistical analysis and forecasting models allows us to better understand the evolving dynamics of Stack Overflow's question ecosystem in the era of AI assistance.
